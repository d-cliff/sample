# Project Summary

Here is some sample code showcasing the tasks you wanted me to complete. To be honest, I love ACF and use it 99% of the time. But for these tasks, you wanted me to use the Gutenberg FSE, which I have limited experience in. I was skeptical at first, but in the end, it was really fun! It went a lot smoother than I thought it would. Hopefully my sample code is up to your standards and demonstrates how versatile I can be. I’m a quick learner! I enjoy learning and testing new technologies.

## Technical Decisions

- Created a child theme from the Twenty Twenty-Five theme.
- Created a basic template that displays the current date with the ability to add blocks.
- Used `@wordpress/create-block` to create a dynamic custom block.
- Modified WordPress behavior by adding a custom logo to the admin bar using a PHP function. In the admin area, I think it’s nice to show client branding rather than WordPress branding.
- Added fun animations to show some movement.

## Improvements

- With more time, I would build more custom blocks, add more animations, and definitely add some color.
- While I currently prefer ACF, this little sample project has intrigued me. I want to test Gutenberg further and gain more knowledge.
- If my code is not up to your standards, please don’t be concerned, I can quickly adapt and get up to speed in no time.
